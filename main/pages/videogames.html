        Bioshock Infinite <br />

        <p>
          <b>Reasons:</b><br />
          The gameplay is very entertaining, especially with the
          vigors that give you very unique abilities. What stands
          out the most, however, is the incredible story.

        <p>
          <b>Reasons:</b><br />
          From the music, to the story, to the gameplay, this game
          is incredible. You can choose to befriend the characters and
          get attatched to them or you can kill them all, and face
          the consequences.

      <li>
        Terraria <br />

        <p>
          <b>Reasons:</b><br />
          This game involves a lot of grinding, but it remains fun
          due to the very diverse and challenging bosses. You can
          also get really creative. I would like it if the game had
          more lore, though.

        <p>
          <b>Reasons:</b><br />
          An incredible sandbox. You can do whatever you want to do.
          Minecraft is also a beautiful canvas where you can build
          incredible things. But if you're looking for a challange,
          you can go kill the enderdragon.

        <p>
          <b>Reasons:</b><br />
          This game is no more than an interactive story. It could've
          been written as a book... but it is a game, and I honestly
          loved it and its music.
